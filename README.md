# Hotel Cancellation Analysis
### Problem Statement:-

-The project aims to conduct Data Cleaning, Visualization and Analysis for a chain of Hotel collected over a tiemspan of 3 years with 36 fields and 1 lakh+ entries to explore the reasons for loss in revenue due to the cancellation of Hotel Bookings like prices, locations, month of booking the hotel, mode of booking etc.

-We assume that the outliers doesn't affect our visualization and can be safely dropped. Biggest factor affecting the effectiveness of earning income is booking cancellations. Cancelled rooms remains
vacant for the booked period of time.

-Further, we intend to provide possible bussiness solutions for the same which can help in increasnig the revenue and efficiency of the usage of hotel rooms. 

### Data Analysis and Visualization

#### Major contribution in cancellations:

- From the above images we can surely say that lowering of revenue for the chain of hotel is indeed due to the increase in **booking cancellations that are about 32% of total bookings made**.
- We can also conclude that the major cancellations are made in tbe City Hotels and i.e about **72% of the total cancellations come from the City Hotels**.

#### Effect of price:

- We also visualized that in the peirod between the period of Sept.'15 - Sept'17 we can see a usual trend of **Average Daily Prices of the City Hotels being higher tham that of the Resort Hotels**.
- During the same period we notice that the usual trend of Hotel Cancellations reveal that the cancellations have taken place when the **Average Daily Prices of the Hotels booked were higher than those that were not cancelled**
- We have here exculded the data beyond the above mentioned time period because of its dis-uniformity due to less data and heavy variance/outliers.

#### Time Period of frequent Cancellations:

- We also visualize that the January Month has the highest average daily rates among all the months and it is the month with the most frequent cancellations than other months which further solidifies our analysis of how the prices have been affecting the cancellation rates.

#### Location Factor:

- We visualize the top 10 countries with most number of hotel cancellations and find that around **70% of the total cancellations have just come from Portugal**.

#### Based on the Deposit Type:

- Contrary to the common logic we find that the **cancellation rates in Non-Refundable Hotel is almost 100%** which means almost every hotel which has the Non-Refundable Deposits are cancelled.

#### Based on Customer Type

- We can observe that the cancellation rates among the **Transient(40% and including Transient-Party it is ~66%) and Contract Customer(~31%) Types** are much higher than the other customer types.

#### Based on the rooms allocted wrt the desired room type:

- We find that about 12% of the total customers couldn't get their desired rom type still there is only ~5% of hotel cancellations among the customers who where not alloted their desired room type.
