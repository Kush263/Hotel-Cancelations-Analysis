**Hotel Cancellation Analysis**

**Description:-**

-The project aims to conduct Data Cleaning, Visualization and Analysis for a chain of Hotel to explore the reasons for loss in revenue due to the cancellation of Hotel Bookings like prices, locations,
month of booking the hotel, mode of booking etc.

-The data exploration and visualization is done over a dataset of 2 years with 30+ fields and 1 lakh+ entries. 

- We assume that the outliers doesn't affect our visualization and can be safely dropped. Biggest factor affecting the effectiveness of earning income is booking cancellations. Cancelled rooms remains
vacant for the booked period of time.
